SALES REGRESSION PROJECT - NOTES

1. Dataset
-------------
- 50 stores
- Predictors: Price (numeric), Urban (Yes/No), US (Yes/No)
- No missing values
- Urban variable mostly 'Yes' for US stores

2. Analysis Steps
------------------
- [x] Fit full multiple regression: Sales ~ Price + Urban + US
- [x] Examine p-values for significance
- [x] Fit reduced model excluding non-significant predictors
- [x] Compare R^2 and Adjusted R^2 for full vs reduced models
- [x] Compute 95% confidence intervals for significant predictors
- [x] Diagnostics: check residuals, leverage, Cook's distance

3. Preliminary Results
-----------------------
- Full model R^2: 0.239, Adjusted R^2: 0.234
- Reduced model R^2: 0.239, Adjusted R^2: 0.235
- Urban not significant (p ~ 0.936)
- Price negative and significant (~ -0.0545)
- US positive and significant (~ 1.2006)
- Intercept ~ 13.0435

4. Equations / Formulas
------------------------
- Multiple regression equation (full model):
  Sales_hat = 13.0435 - 0.0219*Urban_Yes + 1.2006*US_Yes - 0.0545*Price
- Standardized residual: r_i = e_i / (s * sqrt(1 - h_ii))
- Cook's distance: D_i = ...

5. To-Do / Notes
-----------------
- Include plots of residuals
- Check for outliers |r_i| > 2 or 3
- Identify high leverage points h_ii > 2*h_bar
- Influence analysis (Cook's distance D_i > 0.5 or 1)
- Ensure README.md has clean, polished summary for GitHub
